# NumPy Analyzer

This project is a command-line NumPy Analyzer tool that provides:

-   Array creation (1D, 2D, 3D)
-   Mathematical operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication,
    Division)
-   Combining and splitting arrays
-   Indexing and slicing
-   Searching, sorting, and filtering
-   Aggregate and statistical operations

The program is fully menu-driven and interacts with the user through
terminal inputs.

## Features

1.  **Create Array**\
    Allows creating 1D, 2D, or 3D NumPy arrays by specifying dimensions
    and values.

2.  **Mathematical Operations**\
    Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division between
    two arrays of equal size.

3.  **Combine or Split Arrays**

    -   Combine two arrays\
    -   Split one array into two equal parts

4.  **Indexing and Slicing**\
    Supports selecting elements or subarrays.

5.  **Search, Sort, and Filter**\
    Perform element search, sorting, or apply filtering logic.

6.  **Aggregates and Statistics**\
    Compute sum, mean, max, min, and other aggregate functions.

## How to Run

1.  Install NumPy:

    ``` bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

2.  Run the Python script:

    ``` bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

## Notes

-   Follow on-screen menu instructions.
-   Enter valid numeric values to avoid runtime errors.
